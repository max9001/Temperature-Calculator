# [Temperature  Calculator](https://online.saddleback.edu/courses/5717/assignments/199715)
Create a temperature calculator with the following requirements.

#### 1. Input: File input where each line consists of the temperature followed by a temperature type. 
Example:

98.6 F
103.5 C
104.6 C
109.2 K

 

#### 2. Output: File output where each line has all the temperatures. Example:

98.6 F             XXXX C              YYY K

...

 ------------------------------

#### 1. Work on the assignment by yourself and upload your files to Canvas. Use .h and .cpp files. You should submit two solutions. The first solution solves the problem using a procedural approach. The second solution solves the problem using an object-oriented approach. You should upload the following files

`my_procedural_temperature.h`

`my_procedural_temperature.cpp`

`my_oop_temperature.h`

`my_oop_temperature.cpp`

 

#### 2. Work with your group (collaborate) and come up with a solution for which all of you will be graded. Submit a procedural and object-oriented approach.

 

#### 3. Select one person in the group to submit the group submission. Name these files:

`team_members.txt`

`procedural_temperature.h`

`procedural_temperature.cpp`

`procedural_main.cpp`

`procedural_output.txt`

`oop_temperature.h`

`oop_temperature.cpp`

`oop_main.cpp`

`oop_output.txt`

The group submitter will have these files in addition to his/her own personal files. The team_members.txt file should have the name of each group member in the format <last_name>, <first_name>

 

Note that for the individual submissions, I do not need to see a main or output. I only need those files for the group submission.
